LPT: Bring your Trick Or Treating kids to retirement communities or areas where old people live for optimal amounts of candy.
The ratio of kids to candy is usually far outweighed on the candy side in older/slower neighborhoods so they usually give out handfuls to get rid of it. Also, older folks tend to adore kids and company so that's a nice thing to do :) Edit: Got a ton of mixed comments on this one! Lots of people with success stories getting bags of candy while others are still paranoid about receiving fruit, cough drops and old people candy lol. We gave it a shot tonight and it went really well! Yes we got a penny, a cookie and a TON OF CANDY. Worked as expected 👊 Happy Halloween everyone! 🎃  submitted by /u/mattspeakslove [link] [comments]
