LPT: If you found work through a recruiting agency and they ask for feedback about your new job, do NOT say anything negative or mention anything about looking for new work. They will snitch on you and you may end up losing your job.
My workplace has already let go 3 new contract workers because they mentioned they were going to be looking for new work while working there. Recruiters are not your friends. Just keep quiet and look for new work on your own time.  submitted by /u/hlub2006 [link] [comments]
